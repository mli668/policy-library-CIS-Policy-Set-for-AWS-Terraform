## Description

AWS KMS enables customers to rotate the backing key, which is key material stored in AWS KMS and is tied to the key ID of the KMS key. It's the backing key that is used to perform cryptographic operations such as encryption and decryption. Automated key rotation currently retains all previous backing keys so that decryption of encrypted data can take place transparently.

CIS recommends that you enable KMS key rotation. Rotating encryption keys helps reduce the potential impact of a compromised key because data encrypted with a new key can't be accessed with a previous key that might have been exposed.

This rule is covered by the [kms-key-rotation-enabled](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-CIS-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/kms/kms-key-rotation-enabled.sentinel) policy.
