## Description

This control checks whether the number of passwords to remember is set to 24. The control fails if the value is not 24.

IAM password policies can prevent the reuse of a given password by the same user.

CIS recommends that the password policy prevent the reuse of passwords. Preventing password reuse increases account resiliency against brute force login attempts.

This rule is covered by the [iam-password-reuse](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-CIS-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/iam/iam-password-reuse.sentinel) policy.
