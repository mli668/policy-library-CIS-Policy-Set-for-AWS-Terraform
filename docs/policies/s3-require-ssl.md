## Description

DISCLAIMER - This policy works when all resources of type `aws_s3_bucket_policy` are present in the root module and have their `policy` attribute set using `aws_iam_policy_document` datasource.

This control checks whether an Amazon S3 general purpose bucket has a policy that requires requests to use SSL. The control fails if the bucket policy doesn't require requests to use SSL.

S3 buckets should have policies that require all requests (Action: S3:*) to only accept transmission of data over HTTPS in the S3 resource policy, indicated by the condition key aws:SecureTransport.

This rule is covered by the [s3-require-ssl](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-CIS-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/s3/s3-require-ssl.sentinel) policy.
