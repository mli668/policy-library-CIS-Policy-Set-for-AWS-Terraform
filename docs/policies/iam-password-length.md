## Description

Password policies, in part, enforce password complexity requirements. Use IAM password policies to ensure that passwords are at least a given length.

CIS recommends that the password policy require a minimum password length of 14 characters. Setting a password complexity policy increases account resiliency against brute force login attempts.

This rule is covered by the [iam-ensure-password-length-policy](https://github.com/hashicorp/policy-library-CIS-Policy-Set-for-AWS-Terraform/blob/main/policies/iam/iam-password-length.sentinel) policy.
